    <h2>Header</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
             [3] This separation can improve content accessibility </p>

    <h2>section</h2>
         <p class="paragraph">Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All
        font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often
        repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet,
        resulting in considerably simpler HTML. </p>

<aside class="aside">
    <h2>aside</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user and the
        author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type, importance, selector
        specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be in a separate document
        or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be
        applied depending on the output device being used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from
        the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium. </p>

<footer class="footer">
    <h2> footer</h2>
        <p class="paragraph"> CSS facilitates publication of content in multiple presentation formats based on nominal parameters.
            Nominal parameters include explicit user preferences, different web browsers, the type of device being used
            to view the content (a desktop computer or mobile device), the geographic location of the user and many other variables.</p>
